# Coding Assistant Box
This is a Windows Desktop Application. It is essentially a chatbox, it uses the OllamaAPI using OllamaSharp package. I made this in order to help with coding, by using code suggestions, as well as help me code faster by explaining to me how servers API, as an example I am a game developer that uses Unity, and it really cut downs on time searching through the Unity documentation. Feel free to customize this as you please, but please give credit.

## Instructions
- Ollama must be installed. [Link](https://ollama.com/)
